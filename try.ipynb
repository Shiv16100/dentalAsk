      "speaking, for stainers with cervical exposure, a dentifrice with a safety index as high as is consistent with prevention of stain accumulation is desirable. Reliable current information on denti- frice abrasion, determined by testing whole denti- frices on dentin, should be available (Kitchen and Robinson 1948 ). Later efforts, primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, led to the development of formal abrasiv- ity testing procedures, and these served as the basis for standards currently recommended by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). Given the growing consumer expectation for multi-beneﬁ t products, dentifrice formulations need to deliver a level of abrasiveness sufﬁ cient to control staining and plaque buildup, without risking the use of overly aggressive abrasive sys- tems that could be deleterious to hard tissues after long-term use. Some researchers have pro- posed the use of a Cleaning Efﬁ ciency Index as one way to assess the cleaning/abrasion balance (Schemehorn et al. 2011 ). Further work in this area would be helpful, and it needs to incorporate human use studies as part of the evaluation. As a general rule, modern dentifrices are formulated to provide speciﬁ c therapeutic/cosmetic beneﬁ ts while delivering abrasivity levels that are well within the accepted limits, with the goal of ensur- ing consumers receive the best products possible for their speciﬁ c oral health needs. A recently published paper on the history of the develop- ment of abrasivity standards for toothpastes pro- vides an excellent summary of these efforts as well as technical insight into their interpretation regarding not only tooth cleaning potential but also with regard to other oral care issues such as dental erosion (St John and White 2015 ). 16.1.6 Toothpastes and Abrasivity Testing The most widely used method for assessing toothpaste abrasivity is the Radioactive (also referred to as Relative) Dentin Abrasivity (RDA) method, an in vitro radiotracer method developed as an outcome of studies by Grabenstetter et al. (Grabenstetter et al. 1958 ) and Hefferren ( 1976 ). This method has served the industry well, establishing a limit of abra- sivity of an RDA of 250, under which a denti- frice can be used safely on a daily basis for a lifetime. The industry has largely self-regulated since these standards were put in place, with dentifrices being used safely for the last half century. Although the method has been accepted across the industry and practiced for many years, there is a clear need for modern updat- ing. The requirement for radiotracer capabili- ties signiﬁ cantly restricts the ability of many researchers to focus on the development of new abrasive technologies for toothpaste. Over the years, alternative methods have been proposed, such as proﬁ lometry (Addy 2010 ). Although one proﬁ lometry method has received some level of acceptance, until recently proﬁ lometry methods in general have not been thoroughly validated with regard to their ability to directly duplicate the accepted radiotracer method. A number of papers have suggested similar, but not direct, agreement between methods\n",

Procollagen is translocated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Molecular chaper- ones and enzymes regulate foldings and trimer- ization. C-propeptides and N-propeptides are related to the surrounding proteins. They migrate to the Golgi apparatus, traverse the polarized stack of cisternae, and become secretory pro- teins, the globular N- and C-propeptides being removed by procollagen N- and C-proteinases. C-proteinase is a member of the Tolloïd family of zinc metalloproteinases (bone morphogenetic protein-1, BMP-1). The furin-like proprotein Fig. 12.1 Schematic transition between procollagen chains, nucleated under the inﬂ uence of the C-propeptide. The procollagen trimer is transformed into collagen, a process followed by collagen ﬁ brillation (Linsennnmayer 1981 ) M. Goldberg 155 convertases are also implicated in the conversion of latent BMP-1 and ADAMTS2 to a wide vari- ety of substrates. These events occur ﬁ rst intra- cellularly and then at the periphery of the plasma membrane. Collagen ﬁ bril assembly occurs on the cell surface and is mediated by interactions with cell-surface integrins ( α5β1). Fibril- associated molecules are added at the surface of collagen ﬁ brils, and they regulate the diameter and interactions between the ﬁ brils. The initial stage of collagen deposition results in arrays of thin ﬁ brils, which increase in length and diame- ter. Lateral association and end-to-end fusions of collagen ﬁ brils occur and enhanced by the forma- tion of intra- and inter-cross-links resulting from the action of lysyl oxidase enzymes (Canty and Kadler 2005 ). Proteoglycans such as decorin, ﬁ bromodulin, and lumican affect also ﬁ brillogen- esis (Goldberg et al. 2005 ). 12.2 Enamel Surface Smooth (bands of smooth enamel prisms) or pitted (associated with the end of prisms reaching the enamel surface) surfaces are seen in enamel. They are associated with perikymata, where the crystals are radially oriented. Circadian rhythms and approximately an 8-day periodicity are apparent (Newman and Poole 1974 ) (Figs. 12.2 and 12.3 ). 12.3 Morphology of the Cemento- Enamel Junction At the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), the fol- lowing tissue interrelationships were observed: • Pattern I: The cementum overlaps the enamel (42–60 %); the cementoblasts produce an aﬁ - brillar cementum, dense and laminated, devoid of collagen ﬁ brils with a 64 nm periodicity. • Pattern II: Edge-to-edge interrelationship between cementum and enamel (situation seen in 30–41 % of the teeth). • Pattern III: There is a gap between root cemen- tum with exposed dentin (10–12 %) (Arambawatta et al. 2009 ). • Pattern IV: The enamel overlaps cementum (1.6–2 %), (Vandana and Haneet 2014 ) (Figs. 12.2 and 12.4 ). The intermediate cementum is a narrow zone of highly calciﬁ ed tissue. It is located between the most external layer of dentin (granular Tomes’ layer) and the layer of acellular cementum. It is referred to as “the hyaline layer of Hopewell- Smith.” The intermediate cementum layer con- tains enamel matrix proteins and is a product\n",

      "conﬁ dence as they used to, they need to have a good set of functional natural teeth. And, in order to achieve this objective at an old age, tooth-saving actions should start when these peo- ple are young. This suggests that dentists should ask when they perform a procedure: how will what I am doing now affect the life of the tooth and the person when that person has reached old age? And, as discussed above, life expectancy is increasing year by year in most countries, as is the number of natural teeth in these increasingly elderly people. 18.2.2 Its Cornerstones The topics that have played a major role in the development of the MID philosophy are pre- sented below. Fluoride : Many studies from 1940 onwards that have assessed the effect of water ﬂ uoridation and ﬂ uoride toothpaste, varnish, gel and mouth rinses on the progression of carious lesions have contributed greatly to the development of the MID philosophy. These studies have shown that the main long-term action of ﬂ uoride retards the pro- gression of a carious lesion, rather than preventing its development (Backer-Dirks et al. 1961 ). Sugar : Studies from the 1950–1970 period that assessed the effect of various forms of sugar- containing food and beverages revealed that free sugar is an aetiological factor in the onset and progression of carious lesions and that its detri- mental effect can be countered by reducing sugar intake and frequency of consumption. Dental bioﬁ lm : This topic was researched extensively in the 1960s–1980 period. The out- comes of this research resulted in the accep- tance that dental bioﬁ lm, when allowed to become cariogenic, is the main cause of demin- eralisation of tooth surfaces. Bioﬁ lm should be at least disturbed or at best removed from tooth surfaces daily, if carious lesion development is to be minimised. In combination with ﬂ uoride toothpaste, bioﬁ lm removal with a toothbrush has become a major cornerstone in managing carious lesions for communities worldwide (Frencken et al. 2002 ).

Frencken and S.C. Leal 213 Adhesive dental materials : With the appear- ance of the ﬁ rst research article on the use of composite resin in humans (Buonocore 1955 ), tooth cavities could be physically reduced in size, with the result that more healthy tooth structure could remain in place. With the appearance of the ﬁ rst glass-ionomer cement in 1969, a biologi- cally based adhesive dental material was intro- duced (Wilson and Kent 1972 ), which provided preventive care (sealants) and restorative care (restorations).
